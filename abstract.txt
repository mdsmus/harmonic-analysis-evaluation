  Chord labeling is an important part of harmonic analysis. Many
  algorithms have been proposed for it, but there is no objective
  comparison of their main merits and flaws. In this paper we present
  an evaluation of chord labeling algorithms on 28 Bach's chorales,
  comparing Pardo and Birmingham's \cite{pardo.ea02:algorithms} and
  Tsui's \cite{tsui02:harmonic} algorithms and evaluating two new
  proposals: a k-nearest-neighbors and a decision tree classifiers.
  
  Our evaluation methodology tries to be as precise as possible in
  enumerating the errors made by each algorithm. We split the overall
  accuracy in precision and recall, and note which chord types are
  most often mistaken by others. This highlights the difficult areas
  and suggest, for example, how to better extend our training
  corpus. 
  
  We find that Tsui's neural network classifier without contextual
  information is the best labeler for all chord modes in our corpus,
  and enhancing it with the surrounding context is the best way of
  incorporating contextual information in the decision process. Pardo
  and Birmingham's algorithm has a very good recall, but a bad
  precision, probably due to its ignorance of non-chord tones, and is
  outperformed by the k-nearest-neighbors classifier, also a pattern
  matcher. The decision tree's performance in unremarkable.
