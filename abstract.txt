  Chord labeling is an important part of harmonic analysis. There is
  in literature no objective comparison of the main merits and flaws
  of chord-labeling algorithms. In this paper we present such an
  evaluation performed on 28 Bach's chorales, comparing Pardo and
  Birmingham's \cite{pardo.ea02:algorithms} and Tsui's
  \cite{tsui02:harmonic} algorithms and evaluating two new proposals:
  a k-nearest-neighbors and a decision tree classifiers.
  
  In our evaluation methodology we split the overall accuracy in
  precision and recall, and note which chord types are most often
  mistaken by others. This highlights the difficult areas and suggests
  improvements.
